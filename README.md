# Bonsai - iOS

Bonsai is a wellness tracking app built with SwiftUI. The app allows you to track your mood, activities, symptoms, and much more. I found that tracking my physiological and psychological wellness was extremely helpful in becoming more self-aware. An demo video of the app can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF82wqF1rSY).

The app was built with the newly released SwiftUI framework. It utilizes my own implementation of Redux for state management. I also leveraged the new Combine framework for reactive programming.
